# Analyzing Container Performance through Algorithms 
## Project Goal and Scope 

The project aims to assess whether containers hosting applications exhibit better performance compared to virtual machines running the same applications or a laptop. The tools used for this evaluation include:

-Python
-Flask library
-Cryptography library
-Docker
-HTML5
-CSS
-JavaScript

The encryption applications and I/O operations are implemented in Python. Subsequently, using the Flask library and front-end tools, the CPU, memory, and disk consumption results are displayed on a web page. The application retrieves the process ID (PID) of the running application, ensuring that the results are not affected by other processes.
